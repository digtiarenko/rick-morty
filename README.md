::lemon: This project is a modern and minimal **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript** template that is equipped with pre-configured **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and Git hooks powered by **Husky**.

::lemon: It uses **SASS** modules to combine local and global stylings with **variables**, **mixins**, and **templates** to provide a responsive layout baed on **grids** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

::lemon: Additionaly components wrapped with **ErrorBoundary**, **Loader**. And imported with **lazy-load** and **suspence**.

::lemon: For state management and data caching, RTK Query is used. Although it may be redundant for this particular case this project showcases some advanced features of **RTK Query**, including newly added **transformResponse** and **merge**. Combined with **reduxjs/toolkit** and **react-router**, this template provides the necessary core functionality.

::lemon: The app can fetch additional default character cards as well as a search query results using a conditional rendered **"load more" button**. Google authentication has also been added using **Firebase**.
